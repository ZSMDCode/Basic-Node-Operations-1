1. 
'Sort commands.js' outputted the file and then sorted each line alphabetically by the first character
'wc commands.js' outputted 40, 101, 1052 which are the numbers of lines, words, and characters in the file.
'uniq commands.js' outputted the file and did not remove any lines since they are all unique.

2. 
I used `uniq commands.js | wc' as the pipeline to see if it changed and it actually outputted 41, 101, and 1053 which
means there is one new line and one new character. This is due to the new line being counted and also the new line
also counts for one more character.

var reverseString = (string) => {
   var words = string.split(' ');
   var result = [];
   for(var i = 0; i < words.length; i ++){
     result.push(words[i].split('').reverse().join(''));
   }  
   return result.join(' ');
}


console.log(reverseString("Hello my name is Thomas"));
